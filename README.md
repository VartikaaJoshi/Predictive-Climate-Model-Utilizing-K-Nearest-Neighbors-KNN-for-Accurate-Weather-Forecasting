**Predictive Climate Model Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**


**Overview**
This repository contains a simple yet effective predictive climate model based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model aims to forecast weather conditions (Sunny, Rainy, Snowy) based on historical weather data. It uses basic weather attributes such as Temperature, Humidity, and Wind Speed for its predictions.


**Features**
K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm: Leverages the simplicity and effectiveness of the KNN algorithm for weather prediction.
Sample Dataset: Includes a basic dataset to demonstrate the model's functionality.
Custom Predictions: Allows users to input new weather data points for climate forecasting.


**Requirements**
To run this model, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
1. numpy
2. scikit-learn

**Dataset:**
Columns: Temperature (Â°C), Humidity (%), Wind Speed (km/h), Label (Weather Condition)
Labels: Sunny, Rainy, Snowy
This dataset is meant for demonstration purposes and can be expanded for more robust applications.


**Usage**
Clone the Repository: Download the code to your local machine.
Prepare Your Dataset: Use the provided sample dataset or replace it with your dataset following the same structure.
Run the Model: Execute the Python script to train the model.
Make Predictions: Input new weather data points to get the forecast from the model.
